# earthquake-risk
Project for adding tags for buildings at risk of collapsing in a major earthquake

The Los Angeles Times [published a database](http://graphics.latimes.com/soft-story-apartments-needing-retrofit/) from the city of Los Angeles that shows some of the buildings at risk. A seperate, unpublished list has a unique identifier which would match the lacounty:ain already being imported. We could get that list and add that data after planning the tagging schema.

## Next steps
1. Research possible tagging schemes
2. Consult with [talk-us](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-us) on tagging
3. Plan import and document
4. Define update strategy
